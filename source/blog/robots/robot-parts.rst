Robot Parts

:summary: Where do I get robot parts from

Some great places to get robot parts are:

* `Adafruit <http://adafruit.com>`_ A lot of my stuff comes from here. Good prices, lots of learning material and they write a lot of drivers for the hardware they make!
* `Pololu <https://www.pololu.com/>`_ These guys are good with power (e.g., buck, boost, motor). Good prices and they also write some drivers for their hardware
* `Sparkfun <http://sparkfun.com>`_ expensive and support is ok. I would only order from them if I had too.
