Control
----------

There are many ways to control an RC servo and both the Arduino and the RPi have
software libraries to do that. However, that consumes a small amount of overhead (processor
power) and you may not want that.

Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Driver - I2C interface `PCA9685 <https://www.adafruit.com/products/815>`_
is a good hardware solution that is controlled via i2c. This is nice, because you can
hook up a bunch of these and control more servos than you could ever want! The Adafruit
`tutorial <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-16-channel-servo-driver-with-raspberry-pi>`_
does a great job of showing how to hook this up and the python library is
`here <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PCA9685>`_ in their github account.

I used it to make a simple 4 legged (quadruped) robot.

Python
--------

You can also control servos from python via a variety of methods, one is:

.. code-block:: python

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	from __future__ import division
	import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
	import sys
	import time

	angle = float(sys.argv[1])

	def dc(a):
	  DutyCycle = 7/180*a+5
	  return DutyCycle

	GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
	GPIO.setup(26,GPIO.OUT)
	pwm=GPIO.PWM(26,50)
	pwm.start(5)
	a=dc(angle)
	pwm.ChangeDutyCycle(a)

	time.sleep(1)
	pwm.stop()
	GPIO.cleanup()

This will turn an RC servo. Since the timing varies between servos, you will have to
adjust the duty cycle timing for your exact servo.
