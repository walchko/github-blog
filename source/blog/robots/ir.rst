A common range sensor is the Sharp IR sensors which almost every electronics source sells.
These sensors output a beam of modulated light and look for its return. Based on the time
of flight, an analog voltage is returned (see below).

Notice that, although the sensor takes 5V in, it outputs no more than 2.8V. There for this
sensor is safe to work with common 3.3V systems.
