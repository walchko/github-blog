# Adafruit Microcontrollers and Circuitpython

Adafruit's more advanced micro controllers come with a version of
[MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) installed on them called
 [Circuitpython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython).
I have worked with some of these micro controllers and really like them.

## What is it?

CircuitPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

## Documentation

[Read the docs](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/index.html)

## Libraries

There are a lot of libraries available:

- [Adafruit's github repos](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)
- [HCSR-04 drivers](https://github.com/mmabey/CircuitPython_HCSR04)


# Boards

## Trinket M0

The [Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) is a tiny microcontroller
board, built around the Atmel ATSAMD21, a little chip with a lot of power.
