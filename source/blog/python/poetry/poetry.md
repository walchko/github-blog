### Development

For developing a package you could do `pip install -e .` with `pip`. Poetry does a
similar thing with just doing `poetry install`.

### Nice things

- Reduces all of the various config files (`setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, etc) 
to one `pyproject.toml` in [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) so it is *official*
- Poetry is designed to use the new toml file and reduce the headache of packaging

### Not so nice things

-  Install doesn't use `pip` but rather a script you pull with curl: `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`
    - This allows `poetry` to isolate itself from the system distro ... which isn't a bad thing

## Other Run Commands 

- `Flake8`: linting
- [`Black`](https://github.com/psf/black): code formatter to make our stuff [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant
- `pytest`: it appears that `nose` is dead but there is some movement on [`nose2`](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2) ... moving on
