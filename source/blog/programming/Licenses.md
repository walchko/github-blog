title: Various Licenses

There are so many types of open source licenses, it is hard to keep track
of them. Here is a nice summary from
[choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/). If you click
on any of the licenses, a description with clear summary (not shown below
because it is javascript I think) appears along with the a template
of the actual license

## [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring
preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works,
modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and
without source code.
