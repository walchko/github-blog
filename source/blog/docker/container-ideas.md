Here are some some cool containers to play with:

- [plex media server](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker)
- [ros: robotic operating system](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Docker)[*works*]
- [pihole: ad/tracker blocker](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole)
- [droppy: nodejs web based fileserver](https://github.com/silverwind/droppy)
- [cloudcmd: nodejs web based fileserver](https://github.com/coderaiser/cloudcmd)[*works*]
- [octoprint: 3d printing](https://github.com/OctoPrint/docker)

For the containers I have tested, I noted with *works*, but my testing was rather simple.
