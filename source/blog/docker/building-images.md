1. Make a new directory with nothing in it and change into it
1. Make a `Dockerfile`
1. Build it with: `docker build .`

## Example Dockerfile

I am using a simplier version of the [octoprint docker file](https://github.com/OctoPrint/docker/blob/master/Dockerfile). 
This was built on Ubuntu 19.04.

```
```
