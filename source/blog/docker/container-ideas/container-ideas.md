My git repos of docker containers is located [here](https://github.com/walchko/ultron)

- [pihole: ad/tracker blocker](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole) [*works*]
    - difficulty getting it to work Ubuntu, but works with some changes
- [octoprint: 3d printing](https://github.com/OctoPrint/docker)[*works*]


Here are some some cool containers that might be useful:

- [plex media server](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker)[*works*]
- [ros: robotic operating system](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Docker)[*works*]
- [unifi controller](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-unifi-controller)

For the containers I have tested, I noted with *works*, but my testing was rather simple.

I have also played with:

- Cross compiling OpenCV and building debian packages
    - this is really slow ... not sure it is any faster
    - trying to get [this working](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyRobotCompany/dpkg_opencv) better
