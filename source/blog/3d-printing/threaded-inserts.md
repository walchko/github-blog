CNC Kitchen did a great job looking at the strength and usability of
several threaded inserts.

*Summary:*

- You want inserts with a champfered end, easier to insert and keeps plastic out
of the threaded hole
- Want an insert with various knurling in different directions to better grab
on to the plastic
- Inserts with these features were able to resist greater than 300 lbf before being 
pulled out of the PLA
    - Softer materials lowered this value
- When trying to torque the part to failure, the bolt itself broke before the
insert came loose in PLA
    - Again, softer materials allowed the insert to spin before breaking the bolt
