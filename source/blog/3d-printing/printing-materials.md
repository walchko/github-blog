PLA is polylactic acid which is made from corn starch. This material is made
from renewable resources and it is compostable.

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) - This material is a terpolymer of
acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene. Usual compositions are about half
styrene with the balance divided between butadiene and acrylonitrile.
Considerable variation is, of course, possible resulting in many different
grades of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene with a wide range of features
and applications. In addition, many blends with other materials such as
polyvinylchloride, polycarbonates and polysulfones have been developed.
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene materials can be processed by any of the
standard thermoplastic processing methods.Acrylonitrile Butadiene
Styrene (ABS) polymer was first discovered during World War II when its
basis, SBR, was used for alternatives to rubber. Commercially acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene polymers first became available in the early 1950s in an
attempt to obtain the best properties of both polystyrene and styrene
acrylonitrile.
