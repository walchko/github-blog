| Properties | Performance |
|---|---|
| Hardness | carbon steel > 410 > 304 |
| Corrosion Resistance | 304 > 410 > Carbon Steel |
| Anti-Rust (Waterproof) | 304 > 410 > Carbon Steel |
| Magnetic Properties | Carbon Steel (strong) > 410 > 304 (weak or non-magnetic) |

## Corrosion Resistance

Can increase by:

- Increasing the chromium content levels above 11%
- Increase nickle amount above 8%
- Addition of molybdenum (which also improves "pitting corrosion")

## Magnetic Properties

1. 304SS is [austenitic stainless steel][aus]. Dut to the composition segregation and 
imporoper treatment during th eprocess of smeliting stainless steel, it will partially 
transform to the ferritic phase an dwill be partialy magnetic/gerromagnetic. 
So type 304 stainless steel possess paramagnetic characteristics.
1. 304SS is not magnetic in itself, but the magnetic propoerties of eht machines 
will infect the it during production, so some of the 304SS parts will be
slightly magnetic.
1. 410SS is [martensitic stainless steel][mar]. It is magnetic due to the lower
amount of Nickle in it.
