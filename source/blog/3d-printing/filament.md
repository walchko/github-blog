## eSun PLA+

This has worked really well for me on Lulzbot TAZ 6 printers. I used their 3mm version
and various colors: white, red, purple, green, black, probably almost every color they
make.

**Cost:** $$

## Hatchbox Black PLA 1.75mm

TBD

**Cost:** $

## Prusa Silver PLA 1.75mm

The spool of filament that came with my MK3S was really good. The windings were very 
straight and tight with no issues caused by the filament. 

**Cost:** $$$
