Most of this is done on my Prusa Mk3S printer.

## eSun PLA+

This has worked really well for me on Lulzbot TAZ 6 printers. I used their 3mm version
and various colors: white, red, purple, peak green, black, probably almost every color they
make. We had a 3d printer lab and made lots of stuff for our capstone classes.

**Cost:** $$$

## [Overture3d](https://overture3d.com/products/overture-pla-professional-1-75mm) Professional PLA 1.75 +/- 0.05mm

Has some good colors: blue, green, purple, pink, red. Like the cutouts in the side to see how much
filament is left.

## [Hatchbox](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla) PLA 1.75 +/- 0.03mm

Not as neatly wound as Prusa PLA, but works good. Limited colors though I like (*personal opinion*).

- Black: 
    - good
    - grips to MK3S bed well, no need for excessive brim (10mm) that I used on Prusa filament
    - shiny part
    - after a couple weeks, around the last 1/3 of the spool, the filament became very **brittle**
    and broke. Usually it broke in between print jobs when it was sitting for ~12hrs at night
    but not during a print. It usually snapped around the entrance to the print head where the filament
    is forced to straighten out which puts stress on the usually curved filament.

**Cost:** $$

## [Prusa](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/21-pla) PLA 1.75 +/- 0.05mm

The spool of filament that came with my MK3S was really good. The windings were very 
straight and tight with no issues caused by the filament. 

- Silver: 
    - good results
    - shinny part

**Cost:** $$$$ (hard to find in US, shipping expensive)
