Most of this is done on my Prusa Mk3S printer.

## eSun PLA+

This has worked really well for me on Lulzbot TAZ 6 printers. I used their 3mm version
and various colors: white, red, purple, peak green, black, probably almost every color they
make. We had a 3d printer lab and made lots of stuff for our capstone classes.

**Cost:** $$$

## [Overture3d](https://overture3d.com/products/overture-pla-professional-1-75mm) Professional PLA 1.75 +/- 0.05mm

Has some good colors: blue, green, purple, pink, red. Like the cutouts in the side to see how much
filament is left.

- Black:
    - Love this filament, it is the best!
    - I have had this on my printer for months and it never got brittle
    - I personnally like the flatter (non-glossy) look

**Cost:** $$

## Overture3d PETG 1.75 +/- 0.05mm

Has a variety of colors

- Blue:
    - The settings on my Prusa printer for PETG work great
    - It has a glossy finish, unlike the Professional PLA by Overture3d
    - During COVID, it seemed all of the PLA Pro disappeared off Amazon, so I tried this ... not sure if Overture3d is just 
    moving away from their Professional PLA line to PETG or it is a COVID thing
    
**Cost:** $$

## [Hatchbox](https://www.hatchbox3d.com/collections/pla) PLA 1.75 +/- 0.03mm

Not as neatly wound as Prusa PLA, but works good. Limited colors though I like (*personal opinion*).

- Black:
    - good
    - grips to MK3S bed well, no need for excessive brim (10mm) that I used on Prusa filament
    - shiny part
    - after a couple weeks, around the last 1/3 of the spool, the filament became very **brittle**
    and broke. Usually it broke in between print jobs when it was sitting for ~12hrs at night
    but not during a print. It usually snapped around the entrance to the print head where the filament
    is forced to straighten out which puts stress on the usually curved filament.

**Cost:** $$

## [Prusa](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/21-pla) PLA 1.75 +/- 0.05mm

The spool of filament that came with my MK3S was really good. The windings were very
straight and tight with no issues caused by the filament.

- Silver:
    - good results
    - shinny part

**Cost:** $$$$ (hard to find in US, shipping expensive)

# Filaments

## [PLA](https://plastics.ulprospector.com/generics/34/c/t/polylactic-acid-pla-properties-processing)

PLA is polylactic acid which is made from corn starch. This material is made
from renewable resources and it is compostable.

## [ABS](https://plastics.ulprospector.com/generics/1/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene-abs)

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) - This material is a terpolymer of
acrylonitrile, butadiene and styrene. Usual compositions are about half
styrene with the balance divided between butadiene and acrylonitrile.
Considerable variation is, of course, possible resulting in many different
grades of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene with a wide range of features
and applications. In addition, many blends with other materials such as
polyvinylchloride, polycarbonates and polysulfones have been developed.
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene materials can be processed by any of the
standard thermoplastic processing methods.Acrylonitrile Butadiene
Styrene (ABS) polymer was first discovered during World War II when its
basis, SBR, was used for alternatives to rubber. Commercially acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene polymers first became available in the early 1950s in an
attempt to obtain the best properties of both polystyrene and styrene
acrylonitrile.
