I just got my printer and it works great!

- building and calibration: 1.5 days
    - but I could do it faster next time, this was the first building the kit
- First layer print z-offset: -1.200 mm

## Thoughts

- Very quiet compared to the Lulzbot TAZ 6 we had at the Air Force Academy
- Far cheaper ($800 US) and just as good as Lulzbot
- Love the removable print bed ... things pop right off it
