I just got my printer and it works great! (Even 6 months later)

- building and calibration: 1.5 days
    - but I could do it faster next time, this was the first building the kit
- First layer print z-offset: -1.200 mm

## Thoughts

- Very quiet compared to the Lulzbot TAZ 6 we had at the Air Force Academy
- Far cheaper ($800 US) and just as good as Lulzbot
- Love the removable print bed ... things pop right off it

# Lessons Learned

- z-setting for first layer: -1.200 mm
- sensative to brown outs when printing from Octoprint or the SD card ... will go nuts
    - plugged into powercell helps little power hickups
- Temperature sensative even using normal PLA 
    - Only a concern on robotic parts requiring high mechanical accuracy
    - Setting a 10 mm brim around your parts will help them stick to the bed 
    better and not warp as much
    - Close air conditioning vents helps too
    - Turn off ceiling fans helps too
    - I haven't gone as far as using a printer enclosure, but that might be
    the next step if I continue to have problems with parts
