## Soldering Wires

Sparkfun has great info on [working with wiring](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire/all).

## Wiring Current Limits

- You can *theoretically* run large amounts of current through a wire until you hit its melting  point (~2000C for copper). However,
there are other limitations like: conductor size, ambient temperature, number of conductors, internal resistance of wire, and insulation.
    - PVC insulation melts around 100C
    - Silicon insulation melts around 200C
- For high current applications (i.e., robotics, quadcopters, etc), use silicone wire which has a 200C rating
    - *Note:* these are about half the Cooner Wire estimates because they are stranded wire.
    - 16 AWG silicone: ~15A
    - 14 AWG silicone: ~20A
    - 12 AWG silicone: ~30A
- Use good connectors like XT30 or XT60 which handle 30A or 60A peak and half that in normal operation respectively
- Also, as the wire gets longer, internal resistance causes both voltage and current losses. However, for robotics
and things I care about, this generally isn't a big deal
