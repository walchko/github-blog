## Types

- **Ceramic capacitor:**   The ceramic capacitor is a type of capacitor that is used in many applications from audio to RF. Values range from a few picofarads to around 0.1 microfarads. Ceramic capacitor types are by far the most commonly used type of capacitor being cheap and reliable and their loss factor is particularly low although this is dependent on the exact dielectric in use. In view of their constructional properties, these capacitors are widely used both in leaded and surface mount formats
- **Electrolytic capacitor:**   Electrolytic capacitors are a type of capacitor that is polarised. They are able to offer high capacitance values - typically above 1Î¼F, and are most widely used for low frequency applications - power supplies, decoupling and audio coupling applications as they have a frequency limit if around 100 kHz.
- **Tantalum capacitor:**   Like electrolytic capacitors, tantalum capacitors are also polarised and offer a very high capacitance level for their volume. However this type of capacitor is very intolerant of being reverse biased, often exploding when placed under stress. This type of capacitor must also not be subject to high ripple currents or voltages above their working voltage. They are available in both leaded and surface mount formats.

## Decoupling

- Place capabitors as close to power pins as possible
    - Use 0.1uF (100nF) X7R or NP0
