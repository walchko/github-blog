    "# Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit quaternions provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing orientations and rotations of objects in three dimensions. Compared to Euler angles they are simpler to compose and avoid the problem of gimbal lock. Compared to rotation matrices they are more compact, more numerically stable, and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions are composed of a real component (w) and an imaginary component (x,y,z) which has 3 elements. Thus quaternions use 4 variables to represent 3 rotational elements (think Euler: roll, pitch, and yaw) which means they have a redundant parameter. This redundancy allows them to avoid issues seen in Euler. The only problem with them is you have to be able to visualize 3D rotations in 4D space ... good luck! Thus, for humans to visualize them, we typically transform them back to Euler angles. However, the issues we see in Euler angles (gimbal lock) can reappear when we transform them. Note, the gimbal lock only is an issue in Euler angles, quaternions are fine, it is just the transformation to Euler that can have an issue."
