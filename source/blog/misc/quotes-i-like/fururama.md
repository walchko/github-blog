# Futurama

- Godfellas:
    - *God Entity:* Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.
    - *Bender:* Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    - *God Entity:* Yes, if you make it look like an electrical thing. **When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.**
