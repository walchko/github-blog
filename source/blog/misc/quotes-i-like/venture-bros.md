- Brock, why must you be the screen door in my submarine? - Dean Venture
- Dean! Have you been shooting dope into your scrotum?! You can tell me! I’m hip! - Dr. Venture
- Long live that blonde-haired, buttercream frosted murder-cake! - Col Hunter Gathers
- Cheating is what the spy business is all about, boychik. Why, if we don't keep our eyes on our neighbor's paper, the baddies get the bomb and the whole world goes kablooie! You keep thinking you're here on the G.I. Bill or something, kid? YOU ARE NOT HERE TO WRITE ESSAYS! You're not even in college! You are in the Office of Secret Intelligence, you damn, dirty, crybaby FREAK! - Col Hunter Gathers
- Yeah it’s Pat. Pat McCrotch. Yeah is this gonna suck the whole time or is this like the only part that sucks? I just wanna gauge how much suck I’ve gotta friggin sit through. - Dermott
- Oh crap, we didn't plan for this contingency ... quick, make something up! - The Monarch
- Please. How stupid do I look to you? World Domination. I'll leave that to the religious nuts or the Republicans, thank you. - The Monarch
- To prey on their fear, move like an animal, to feel the kill. - Brock Samson
- Smurfs:
    - *Henchmen 24:* Come on! They have one female servicing a large group of males. That implies a species that lays eggs.
    - *Henchmen 21:* Oh my God, you're crazy! They're so obviously mamals!
    - *Henchmen 24:* Please! She'd be in estrus 24/7 if she didn't lay eggs.
    - *Henchmen 21:* Smurfs don't lay eggs! I won't tell you this again! Papa Smurf has a fucking beard! They're mamals!
