- Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. We’re all going to die - Morty
- To live is to risk it all; otherwise you’re just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you - Rick
- I’m a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don’t like something about the world, I change it - Pickle Rick
- Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty - Rick
- The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them - Rick
