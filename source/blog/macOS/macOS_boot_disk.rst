macOS Boot Disk

:summary: Making a USB boot disk

Since operating systems do not come with installation disks anymore, it can be
useful to have something (non-networked) in re-install macOS from just incase
you don't have access to the internet. This will make a simple bootable USB
thumb drive with everything you need to re-install macOS with.

Need
-----

* 8 GB or larger thumb drive
* Your user account needs to have admin rights
* The macOS installer from the App Store

Steps
------
1. Ensure your drive is named ``Untitled``, otherwise rename it.

2. Run the Terminal command in the same location as the installer::

    sudo Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app --nointeraction

3. **Warning:** This step will erase the destination drive or partition, so make
sure that it doesnâ€™t contain any valuable data.

4. The Terminal will display some info, but, depending on the speed or your
mac, it could take 20-30 mins. Just wait until it says ``Copy Complete``.

You can rename the thumb drive to something other than ``Untitled`` now.
