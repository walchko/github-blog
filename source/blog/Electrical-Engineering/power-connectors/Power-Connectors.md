## B1 - Deans (T) type main connector

Used for main connection to speed controllers and motors. Used for medium to high current draw. They can be hard to solder (needs lots of heat) and sometimes
the metal connector eventually slips through the plastic holder.

## B2 - JST / BEC type main connector

Used for main connection to speed controllers and motors. Used for low current draw

## B3 - Tamiya main battery plug

Usually used on Car and Boat batteries (NiCd / NiMh) - Female & Male

## B4 - Bullet Connectors

Single wire connectors, available in a range of different sizes to suit current draw / load requirements from 2mm to 8mm

## B5 - HXT Connectors

Available in 3.5mm and 4.00mm sizes. Used for main battery connectors for medium / high power applications

## B6 - Traxxas Connectors

Mainly used on high current draw car and boat batteries

## B7 - XT60 Connectors

Used for high current (60A) draw battery connections. There is no patient on the
connector so many different companies make this connector. It is easier to solder
wires to and due to the better design, the metal connectors don't slip out of the
plastic holder like the Deans connector.

## B8 - EC3 Connectors

Used for high current draw battery connections

## B9 - Flight Power / Thunder Power (FP / TP) LiPo Balance Charger plug

## B10 - Hyperion / PolyQuest (HP / PQ) LiPo Balance Charger plug

## B11 - JST-XHR (XH) LiPo Balance Charger plug

## B12 - JST-EHR (EH) LiPo Balance Charger plug

## XL30 Connectors

These are the smaller version of the XL60 connector and only support 30A, but
the connector is also smaller. Best to use it with 16/18 gauge wire:
