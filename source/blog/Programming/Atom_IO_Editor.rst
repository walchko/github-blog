:summary: The Atom editor

`Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ editor by Github. It is really good and has a package
system to support a variety of languages and other things (like rst/latex
preview).

`Some Useful Packages <https://atom.io/packages>`_:

* `language-restructuredtext <https://atom.io/packages/language-restructuredtext>`_ - color code rst files
* `rst-preview <https://atom.io/packages>`_ (use shift-cntl-e to see what the rst file looks like)
* `linter-flake8 <https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8>`_ - automatically checks python code
    * Settings, ignore errors: W191, E501, E701, E128, W293
* `minimap <https://atom.io/packages/minimap>`_ - shows all of your code in a small minimap on the right
* `pigments <https://atom.io/packages/pigments>`_ - finds HTML colors and displays them
* `rest-client <https://atom.io/packages/rest-client>`_ - simple rest testing client
* `todo-show <https://atom.io/packages/todo-show>`_ - finds your FIXME, TODOs, etc in a project and puts them all on one page

Theme:

* `seti-icons <https://atom.io/packages/seti-icons>`_ - change the default icons

I am also using this for Latex:

* `language-latex <https://atom.io/packages/language-latex>`_ - for syntax highlighting
* `latex <https://atom.io/packages/latex>`_ - for building latex docs
    * Windoze: install texlive from `Tex User Group <http://www.tug.org>`_ and in the setting window, put the path to the binary
    * OSX: install mactex from tug.org and in settings for tex bin location: /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86_64-darwin
    * package settings - set to preview the pdf after a successful build
* `pdf-view <https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view>`_ - to view the document in Atom after it is built
