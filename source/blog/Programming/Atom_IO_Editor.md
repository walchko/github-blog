# Atom

:date:   2016-03-27

[Atom] editor by Github. It is really good and has a package system to
support a variety of languages and other things (like rst/latex
preview).

[Some Useful Packages]:

-   [language-restructuredtext] - color code rst files
-   [rst-preview] - use shift-cntl-e to see what the rst file looks like
-   [linter-flake8] - automatically checks python code
	-   Settings, ignore errors: W191, E501, E701, E128, W293
-   [minimap] - shows all of your code in a small minimap on the right
-   [pigments] - finds HTML colors and displays them
-   [rest-client] - simple rest testing client
-   [todo-show] - finds your FIXME, TODOs, etc in a project and puts
    them all on one page

Theme:

-   [seti-icons] - change the default icons

I am also using this for Latex:

-   [language-latex] - for syntax highlighting
-   [latex] - for building latex docs
        -   Windoze: install texlive from [Tex User Group] and in the
            setting window, put the path to the binary
        -   OSX: install mactex from tug.org and in settings for tex bin
            location: /usr/local/texlive/2015/bin/x86\_64-darwin
        -   package settings - set to preview the pdf after a successful
            build

-   [pdf-view] - to view the document in Atom after it is built
