## Stress

Uniaxial stress is $\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$ where $F$ is force (N) and $A$ is area ($m^2$)

- Compressive stress (squash)
- Tensile stress (pull)
- Shear stress (scissors)

## Strength Terms

- Yield strength: lowest stress that produces permanent deformation
- Compressive strength: compressive stress that leads to failure
- Tensile strength: tensile stress that leads to failure
- Fatigue strength: measure of material strength un cyclic loads
- Impact strength: capability of material to withstand suddenly applied loads and is expressed in terms of energy

## Tensile Strength

Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is the ability of a material to withstand loads which try
to elongate it. A tensile test records a materials engineering stress verse strain.
The **highest** point of the stress-strain curve is the UTS.

# PLA vs ABS

**ABS** plastic filament stands for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.
It is a sturdy and strong plastic that is oil-based.

**PLA** filament is made from sugarcane and cornstarch which are organic
materials called  polylactic acid. Unlike ABS, PLA has a crystaline
structure (due to sugar and cornstarch) which makes it brittle. Any cracks
that form tend to propagate easily. Also, under the right compost conditions,
PLA is biodegradable.

- Average tensile strengths of 28.5 MPa for ABS and 56.6 MPa for PLA
- Average elastic moduli of 1807 MPA for ABS and 3368 MPa for PLA
    - This is looking at a material's ability to resist distortion and returning to its original shape *after* a load is removed

So what you can take away from this is, PLA is stronger, but more brittle (likely
to fracture especially under impact loads).
