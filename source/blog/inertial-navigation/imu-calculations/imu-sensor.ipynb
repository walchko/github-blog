    "An inertial sensor is composed of several individual sensors. Generally, at a minimum there is an accelerometer to measure inertial forces and a gyroscope to measure rotational rate. However, magnometers capable of measuring the Earth's magnetic field have become cheap and are often included in low cost IMUs. These sensors can be used almost as is to calculate useful things.\n",
