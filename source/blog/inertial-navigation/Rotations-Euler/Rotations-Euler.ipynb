    "The mathematical transformation between a body fixed frame and an inertial (non-moving) frame can be done with a rotation matrix. Euler developed a series of them, with the Aerospace Industry settling on the 3-2-1 sequence to go between a moving body and an inertial frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $R_{321} = R_{zyx} = R(\\psi)R(\\theta)R(\\phi)$ is the standard. Thus a vector in body space is related to its inertial vector by $v^I = R_{321} v^b$. The sequence is:\n",

    "Now you could integrate this equation in order to update the Euler angles given gyro measurements ($\\Phi \\mathrel{{+}{=}} \\omega_B \\Delta t$). However, Euler angles have issues (i.e., gimbal lock) so typically engineers use quaternions instead to track the orientation of a rigid body. However, since quaternions are a 4D representation of 3D space, they are highly non-intuitive. Therefore, the quaternion is typically transformed back into Euler angles for human understanding only."
