Windows
==============

:summary: Windows setup

Windows is a horrible operating system that is highly useless and designed
for idiots. So how can you make it more useful like unix or linux?

Git Bash
-----------

Get a command line and a subset of useful programs::

	# generated by Git for Windows
	test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
	test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc

	alias python='winpty python.exe'
	alias ll='ls -l'
	alias ls='ls -F --color=auto --show-control-chars'
	alias node='winpty node.exe'

* `Git bash <https://git-scm.com/>`_

Python
--------

Download and install python 2.7.x for windows. As of this writing, there are
still a lot of useful packages that do not support python 3.x.

* `python <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_

OpenCV
-------

Download and install opencv 3.x for windows.

* `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/downloads.html>`_
