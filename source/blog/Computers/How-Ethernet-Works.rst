:summary: How ethernet and cat5 cables work

BaseT
--------

A standard ethernet cable (Cat 5, CAT 5E, or Cat 6) has 4 pairs of cables (8 wires total).
For 10BaseT (10Mbps) and 100BaseT (100Mbps) they only use 2 pairs of wires:

=== =================== ==============
Pin Color               Function
=== =================== ==============
1   White with Green    +TD
2   Green               -TD
3   White with Orange   +RD
4   Blue                Not Used
5   White with Blue     Not Used
6   Orange              -RD
7   White with Brown    Not Used
8   Brown               Not Used
=== =================== ==============

From the table above, you can see that 10/100BaseT only uses the Green and Orange twisted
pairs of wires. Where TD and RD are transmit and receive. The +/- is an inverted polarity
system to reduce noise and increase performance. Basically, if +TD is at +5V, then -TD is
at 0V. This mirroring, helps to reduce reduce noise effects that could drown out a normal
signal over long distances.

Now for 1000BaseT, it operates the same way, but gigabit uses all 4 pairs (8 wires)
to communicate.
