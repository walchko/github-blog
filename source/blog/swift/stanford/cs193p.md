This is a really well taught class that is fairly easy to follow if you have
some experience in another programming language.

##  Model View ViewModel (MVVM)

- **Model:** Single source of truth (state) about the app
    - contains data (state) and logic
    - User interface independent, the source should not need to `import SwiftUI`
    - `struct Bar {...}`
- **ViewModel:** gatekeeper between model and view that converts data into a useable form for the view
    - `class Foo: ObservableObject { @Published var foobar = Bar()}`
    - This instanciates the model object
    - The VM can expose the entire model (shown above) or just parts of it (less is better!)
- **View:** a stateless (sort of) interface displayed to the user that is data driven (from the model)
    - Reflects current state of model and updates when a model change occurs
        - `Views` are just a scene graph and it knows which `Views` need to be re-drawn ... not all will be changed
        - Swift can detect changes in `structs` easily, which is why models are `struct`
        - Swift uses a publish/subscribe paradim to handle this notification for updating `Views`
        - `Views` are lightweight and only last long enough to update screen and then destroyed
        - `Views` only call `func body()` when being re-drawn
    - The view could have some state knowledge, but it should be minamal and for short times (like during a pinch gesture)
    - `struct Bob: View { @ObservedObject var foo: Foo}`

| MVVM      | Type     | `import`   | Pattern            |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------------------|
| Model     | `struct` | Foundation | `struct Bar {...}` |
| ViewModel | `class`  | SwiftUI    | `class Foo: ObservableObject { @Published var foobar = Bar()}` |
| View      | `struct` | SwiftUI    | `struct Bob: View { @ObservedObject var foo: Foo}` |

## Syntax Notes

- Swift is a functional programming language
- Functions:
  ```swift
  func bob() {...}
  func bob(data: Int) -> [Int] {...} // takes an integer and returns an array of integers
  func bob(data: Data) where Data: Collection, Data.Element: Identifiable -> [Int] {...}
  ```
- Unit conversions for all kinds of things like distance:
  ```swift
  let distance = 1234.0 // meters as a double
  let distMeters = Measurement(value: distance, unit: UnitLength.meters)
  let distMiles = distMeters.converted(to: .miles).value
  ```
- formatting a float as you would in C: `print(">> %.f", variable")`
- `LazyGrid` and other `Lazy` classes only process what is shown on the screen making them faster instead of processing everything ... example: a list of 10,000 emails where only the first 10 are able to fit in on the screen
- Return Results which has a `.success` and `.failure`:
  ```swift
  struct MyError {
      static badValue
      static goodValue
  }
  
  func bob(data: Int) -> Results<Int,Error> {
      if data <= 0 { return .failure(MyError.badValue) }
      else { return .success(data) }
  }
  ```
- `class` is _always_ **mutable** and passed by reference
    - Constructors/destructors are `init`/`deinit`
- `struct` is _always_ **immutable** and passed by value (copied)
- `protocol` is a stripped down `struct`/`class`
    - No storage or implementation, just a template
    - Can have an implementation **if** an extension is written

## Imports

Some useful libraries to `import`:

- Collections
    - `Deques`
    - `OrderedSet`
    - `OrderedDictionary`
- Numerics
    - `Real` for creating function templates for mathematics
- os
    - `Logger`

## Try

```swift
// ignore any error and return nil instead
if let data = try? somefunc() { ... }

// crashes your program if an error is thrown, good for debugging
try! somefunc()

// rethrows an error, whoever calls foo() needs to use: try foo()
func foo() throws {
    try somefunc()
}

do {
    try somefunc()
} catch error {
    ...
}
```

## System Icons

- Use `Image`: `Image(systemName: "folder")`
- Use the SF Symbol viewer to find the icon you want to use
- Use modifiers to change size, color, etc

## Key Words

| Keyword and Symbol | Definition |
|--------------------|------------|
| `@State`           | `var` is moved to heap, tracks `private var` of a `View`, forces `View` to be re-drawn, use sparingly |
| `@StateObject`     | SwiftUI owns the `ObservableObject`, creation/destruction owned by a `View`'s lifecycle, and instantiated before `body()` |
| `@ViewBuider`      | function returns a `View` |
| `ObservableObject` | a `class` that publishes changes to its parameters |
| `@Published`       | notification will be published on `willchange` of a parameter, connected to `@ObservedObject` |
| `@ObservedObject`  | tracks an object owned by something else as a dependancy (`View` updated on change) |
| `@Binding`         | like `@State`, but data is owned by another `View`, can be created by passing with `$varName` (variable with `$` at front) to `View` |
| `@escaping`        | |
| `@EnvironmentalObject` | an efficient way to pass an ObservedObject tracked by a root, to a deeply nested child without having to pass the object through the entire tree to the child |
| `@discardableResult` | |
| `?`            | check to see if `var` exists or is `nil`, if `nil` don't continue |
| `!`            | |
| `private(set)` | makes the `set` private, but the `get` is still public |
| `mutating`     | Any function that changes a parameter is written as: `mutating func bob() {...}` |
| `let`          | a constant |
| `var`          | a variable |
| `guard` | trap invalid parameters passed to functions, Ex: `guard age > 18 else { return false }` |
| `fileprivate`  | only methods within the same file can freely use this, any method outside of this file cannont use this parameter/function/etc |

```swift
struct A: View {
    @State private var bob: Bool = true
    var b = B($bob) // passed with $ for binding, update to bob redraws A and B
    ...
}

struct B: View {
    @Binding var isTrue: Bool // owned by A, tracked by B as dependancy
    ...
}
```

## Logging

```swift
// Log a message to the default log and default log level.
let defaultLog = Logger()
defaultLog.log("This is a default message.")

// Log a message to the default log and debug log level
defaultLog.debug("This is a debug message.")

// Log an error to a custom log object.
let customLog = Logger(subsystem: "com.your_company.your_subsystem", 
      category: "your_category_name")
customLog.error("An error occurred!")
```

## Crazy `enum`:

```swift
enum Link {
    case blank
    case url(URL)
    case imageDate(Data)
    
    // syntax sugar, not sure I really understand the utility/advantage
    var url: URL? {
        switch self {
        case .url(let url): return url
        default: return nil
    }
    
    var imageData: Data? {
        switch self {
        case .imageData(let data): return data
        default: return nil
    }
}
```

## Multithreading

- Swift uses **queues** (blocks of code, lined up, waiting for a thread to execute them) to handle the complexity of multithreaded code
- our blocks of code are just closures
- the main queue is the *most* important queue
    - all UI work **must** be run off the main queue
- background queues are available for **non-UI** and long-lived jobs
    - You can define queque priority and "quality of service"
- Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)
    - **main queue:** `DispatchQueue.main`
    - **background queue:** `DispatchQueue.global(qos: QoS)` the QoS are defined as:
        - `.userInteractive`: do this fast, the UI depends on it
        - `.userInitiated`: the user just asked to do this, so do it now
        - `.utility`: this needs to happen but the user didn't just ask for it
        - `.background`: maintenance tasks (cleanups, etc)
    - End up nesting these closures
    - Once you have a queue, use a closure to describe the code to execute:
        - `let queue = DispatchQueue.main or DispatchQueue.global(qos:)`
        - `queue.async { ... }`
            - non-blocking, common, will finish "sometime later"
        - `queue.sync { ... }`
            - blocking, not common
            - don't use for UI

## DocC

```swift
 /// Eat the provided specialty sloth food.
 ///
 /// Sloths love to eat while they move very slowly through their rainforest
 /// habitats. They're especially happy to consume leaves and twigs, which they
 /// digest over long periods of time, mostly while they sleep.
 ///
 /// When they eat food, a sloth's `energyLevel` increases by the food's `energy`.
 ///
 /// - Parameters:
 ///   - food: The food for the sloth to eat.
 ///   - quantity: The quantity of the food for the sloth to eat.
 ///
 /// - Returns: The sloth's energy level after eating.
 ///
 /// - Throws: `SlothError.tooMuchFood` if the quantity is more than 100.
```

 |     |              | compression, encryption). This is where TLS lives.           |

 | 3   | Network      | Provides the capability to send data sequences between       |
