## Comparison with Traditional Cameras

Traditional cameras suffer from:

- Latency
- Motion blur
- Dynamic range

Event cameras:

- Sensor only measures only motion in the scene
- First commercialized in 2008 under the name of Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS)
- Low-latency (~1 usec)
- No motion blur
- Asyncronous pixel response, no intensity information, just polarity
- High dynamic range (140 dB instead of 60 dB)
- Ultra-low power (mean: 1mW vs 1W)
