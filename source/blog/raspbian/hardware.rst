Pinouts
-------

Depending on the version of the rpi you have, there are different
pinouts for the different versions. A great resource is
`Pinout <http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout>`__ to figur out what pin is
what.

Lights
------

The main indicators are the lights on the front corner of the board.
These are::

    OK (green): The board is active (blinks off when accessing the SD card)
    PWR (red): The board is successfully powered from USB
    FDX (green): Network is full-duplex
    LNK (green): The network cable is connected (blinks off when transferring data to/from the network)
    10M (yellow): Lit when the board is using a 100Mbps link, not lit when using a 10Mbps

USB Camera
----------

To use the Logitech C270 camera you need to add your user (pi in this
case) to the video group::

    sudo usermod -a -G video pi

For other users, just change pi to the correct username. Then make sure
the driver is loaded::

    sudo modprobe uvcvideo

You can double check it works by grabbing an image::

    sudo apt-get install fswebcam

    fswebcam image.jpg

If an image appeared, then all is good.
