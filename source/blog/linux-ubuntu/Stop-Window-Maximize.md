title: Stopping Windows Maximize, Ubuntu 18.04
---

I hate when a window I am dragging around accidentally
hits the top of the screen and suddenly maximizes. To
turn it off, open a terminal window and type:

```
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter edge-tiling false
```

I don't know who thinks this is a good idea, but they
are dumb asses!
