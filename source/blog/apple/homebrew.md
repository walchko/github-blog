Some useful [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) programs:

-   arp-scan: find hosts
-   arping: find hosts
-   cmake: build software
-   htop-osx: colorized top
-   nmap: network mapping
-   node: build servers with javascript
-   pandoc: swiss army knife of document conversion
-   pcap: capture network packages
-   pkg-config: build software
-   python: language
-   ruby: language

**Note:** Although I install languages like python, I use `pip` to
handle python packages.
