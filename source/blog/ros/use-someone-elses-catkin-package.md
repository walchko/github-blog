title: How to use Someone Else's Catkin Package

When using someone else's catkin package, here is what you do:

1. mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
1. cd catkin_ws/src
1. git clone https://github.com/repo.git
1. cd ..
1. rosdep install --from-paths src -i -y
1. catkin_make
1. source devel/setup.bash

So basically, we created a workspace, downloaded the code, installed depences, and sourced
the setup file.

I really hate how complex catkin is!!!
