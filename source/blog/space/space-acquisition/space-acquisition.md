"The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at 
sea. They will be fought in space, or possibly on top of a very 
tall mountain. In either case, most of the actual fighting will be
done by small robots. And as you go forth today remember, always,
your duty  is clear: To build and maintain those robots. Thank you."
